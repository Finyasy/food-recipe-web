                        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                        <p>Wash the meat and let it dry. Make incisions on the meat then place it in a bowl. 
                            Make a mixture of grounded garlic, ginger, and lemon juice.
                            Add the mixture to the meat in the bowl and mix it up to marinate.
                            Ensure the mix enters the cuts you have made.
                            Cover the bowl and leave it for two hours (can be refrigerated.)
                            Light a charcoal grill Wait for the coal to attain the desired temperature then place the meat over wire mesh.
                            Add one tablespoon of salt to a little water.
                            Mix it with a tablespoon of oil Sprinkle it on the meat as it cooks.
                            Keep turning the meat regularly for it to cook adequately on both sides.
                            The excess fat on the meat will help tenderize it as it cooks.
                            Once the exterior has turned golden brown, slice the meat to check if it is cooked inside.
                            When the meat is ready, wrap it in a foil and place it on the grill having low heat as it waits to be served.</p>
